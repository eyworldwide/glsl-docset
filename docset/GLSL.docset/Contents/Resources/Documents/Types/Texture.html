<p>The data type <strong>sampler2D</strong> is used to provide access to a 2D texture. It can only be declared as a uniform variable since it is a reference to data that has been loaded to a texture unit.</p>
<p>Side note: On iOS devices this data type can only be used in the fragment shader since they don't have texture image units that can be accessed by the vertex shader.</p>
<h2 id="cubemap-texture">Cubemap texture</h2>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">uniform</span> <span class="hljs-type">samplerCube</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">texture</span>;</code></pre>
<p>The data type <strong>samplerCube</strong> is used to provide access to a cubemap texture. It can only be declared as a uniform variable since it is a reference to data that has been loaded to a texture unit.</p>
<p>Side note: On iOS devices this data type can only be used in the fragment shader since they don't have texture image units that can be accessed by the vertex shader.</p>
