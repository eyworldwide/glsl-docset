# CONDITIONAL EXECUTION



## If statement

    if() {}

The keyword **if** is used to describe the conditional execution of a statement. The parentheses enclose the expression that defines the condition. The curly braces enclose the statements that are executed if the condition evaluates as true.

    if(i != 0) { aFunction(); }

In contrast to a loop the statements in curly braces are executed only one time or not at all.



## Else statement

    if() {} else {}

The keyword **else** is used in conjunction with the keyword if to describe the alternative execution of a statement. The parentheses enclose the expression that defines the condition. The curly braces after the if statement enclose the statements that are executed if the condition evaluates as true. The curly braces after the else statement enclose the statements that are executed if the condition evaluates as false.

    if(i != 0) { aFunction(); } else { bFunction(); }

Depending on the condition either the statements in the first curly braces or the statements in the second curly braces are executed.
